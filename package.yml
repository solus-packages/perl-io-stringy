summary    : IO-stringy - I/O on in-core objects like strings and arrays
description: |
    This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional and object-oriented i/o) on things *other* than normal filehandles; in particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines. In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have IO::AtomicFile which may be used to painlessly create files which are updated atomically. And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have IO::Wrap, whose exported wraphandle() function will clothe anything that's not a blessed object in an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can just use OO syntax and stop worrying about whether your function's caller handed you a string, a globref, or a FileHandle.
